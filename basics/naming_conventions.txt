package main

// use small letters to name packages and short & understandable words...... no camel case or _

//var Name string= "Zain"
// identifiers starting with capital letter are exported and visible to same package and  must be outside func means on package level like this Name. capital letter inside func does nothing

// type Employee struct{
// 	FirstName string
// 	LastName  string
// 	age       int
// }

// Employee is exported across packages and can be imported by other packages.
// its fields FirstName and LastName do too but not age as it starts with small letter.
// each field and method inside struct or interface needs to be exported seperately
// if struct or interface itself is not exported then its exported fields are useless e.g,

// type master struct{
// 	Name string
// 	age int
// }

// as master isnt exported...so Name is useless even if it is exported


func main(){
// Pascal case
//only used to export identifiers(when they are on package level only)

// snake_case
// to name files (use small letters + underscore) e.g, order_service.go  ...no space or hyphen -

	//Name3:="Bazel"  //not exported as it is in func and not on package level
